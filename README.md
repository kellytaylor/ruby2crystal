# Goal
# 1. Figure out all the main syntax differences between crystal and ruby.
# 2. Validate that you can pass in a single file and it converts correctly.
# 3. Then make it work with a directory of .rb files that creates a new directory at the same level with .cr files.
# 4. Write tests to validate different types of syntax
# 5. Figure out how to create macros for meta-programming.
